# Android SMS App

Welcome to the Android SMS App repository! This repository contains the source code and necessary resources for an SMS application developed using Android Studio and Kotlin. With this app, users can send and receive SMS messages on their Android devices.

## Features

- **Send SMS:** Users can compose and send SMS messages to any phone number.
- **Receive SMS:** Incoming SMS messages are received and displayed in the app's inbox.
- **Message Threads:** Conversations with individual contacts are displayed in separate threads.
- **Contact Management:** Users can view and manage their contacts within the app.
- **Notifications:** Notifications are generated for incoming SMS messages.

## Prerequisites

Before running the app, make sure you have the following:

- Android Studio: The latest version of Android Studio installed on your machine.
- Android Device: An Android device or emulator running Android 5.0 (API level 21) or higher.
- Permission: The necessary permission to send and receive SMS messages.

## Configuration

Before running the app, you may need to perform some additional configuration:
